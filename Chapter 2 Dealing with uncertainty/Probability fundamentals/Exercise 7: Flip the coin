Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of "11" in an input sequence of zeros and ones. 
The input of the program is just the sequence and it should return a single number, which is the number of occurrences of "11".

def count11(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    print(n)
    cnt = 0
    # i=0;
    print(cnt)
    # print(i) 
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if seq[i] == 1 and seq[i + 1] == 1:
            cnt += 1
            # i+=1;
    return cnt

print(count11([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])) # this should print 2
