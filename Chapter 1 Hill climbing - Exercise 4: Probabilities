Recall the program that prints out the word 'dog' with 20% probability. 
Modify the program so that it prints either the word 'dog' or the word 'cat' (but never both, because either you're a dog person or a cat person, but not both, right?)

Change the probability of the word 'dog' to be 80% probability (because apparently there are more dog lovers than cat lovers in the world) 
so that the probability of the word 'cat' is 20%.

import random

def main():
    prob = 0.20
    if random.random() > prob:
        print('dog')
    else:
        print('cat')
 

main()

# Advanced

Write a program that prints "I love" followed by one word: the additional word should be 'dogs' with 80% probability, 'cats' with 10% probability, and 'bats' with 10% probability.

Here's an example output:

I love bats

import random

def main():
    prob = 0.80
    if random.random() < prob:
        print("I love dogs")
    else:
        print("I love " + random.choice(['cats', 'bats']))
        
        
    
main()

Example solution

   import random

   x = random.random()
   if x < 0.8:
      favourite = "dogs"
   elif x < 0.9:
      favourite = "cats"
   else:
      favourite = "bats"
      
   print("I love " + favourite)
